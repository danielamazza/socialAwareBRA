#  Social-Aware Biased-Randomized Algorithm

This is the code related to the article "A Social-Aware Biased-Randomized Algorithm for Mobile Cloud Computing in Smart Cities".
In a typical Smart City ecosystem, where a great affluence of mobile devices aims to perform applications at the same time, a competition for allocating remote resources occurs, becoming a potential cause of delay and energy consumption.
Considering these issues, the computation offloading in a Smart City can be seen as a cell association (CA) and resource allocation (RA) problem. In the past, deterministic greedy heuristics have been proposed to solve this problem. 
In a greedy heuristic, each device tries to maximize its individual utility function by choosing the best network node for the transmission. 
We propose a probabilistic algorithm that makes use of biased-randomization techniques in order to enhance the quality of the solution from a \emph{social} or collective point of view. 
The MCC is exploited for accomplishing applications in a cooperative way, to satisfy the Quality of Service requirements for the maximum number of citizen involved, making effective a vision where Smart City services allow to enhance performance and well-being of the community.
